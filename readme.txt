🌍 EventSafe: AI-Powered Event Weather Safety System

EventSafe is an AI-driven platform that empowers event organizers, safety officers, and local authorities to plan safe, weather-resilient outdoor events using real-time atmospheric intelligence, multi-source data fusion, and predictive analytics.

“Making every event safe, sustainable, and weather-resilient — powered by space-grade intelligence.”

🚀 Built for NASA Hackathon 2025

EventSafe integrates NASA Earth Observation data, OpenWeather intelligence, and AI-assisted analytics to generate hyperlocal, dynamic event safety insights.
The system evaluates temperature, precipitation, wind anomalies, air quality, and natural hazard indices to provide an AI-verified Event Safety Score — helping planners make informed, data-backed decisions before the first raindrop falls.

🛰 NASA & Atmospheric Resources Utilized

EventSafe leverages multi-layered, open Earth datasets for enhanced reliability, spatial precision, and climatological depth:

Source	Purpose
NASA POWER API	Solar radiation, temperature, and humidity datasets
NASA GES DISC	Climate reanalysis and precipitation monitoring
NASA Earth Observatory	Aerosol concentration and extreme event visualization
NASA FIRMS	Wildfire detection and proximity alerts
NASA SEDAC	Socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability indices
NASA Earthdata Cloud	Real-time rainfall and hazard prediction layers
NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)	Evaluates atmospheric stability for outdoor conditions

By integrating these with OpenWeather and Open-Meteo APIs, EventSafe delivers a 360° view of environmental risk around event sites.
